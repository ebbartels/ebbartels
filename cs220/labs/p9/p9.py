# # Project 9: Analyzing the Movies

# + [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# ## Learning Objectives:
#
# In this project, you will demonstrate your ability to:
# - Use `matplotlib` to plot bar graphs and visualize statistics
# - Process data using dictionaries and lists that you build
# - Implement binning by writing algorithms that create dictionaries
# - Custom sort a list using the keyword parameter `key`'s argument.
#
# Please go through [lab-p9](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs220/cs220-f22-projects/-/tree/main/lab-p9) before starting this project. The lab introduces some useful techniques necessary for this project.

# + [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# ## Note on Academic Misconduct:
#
# **IMPORTANT**: p8 and p9 are two parts of the same data analysis. You **cannot** switch project partners between these two projects. That is if you partnered up with someone for p8, you have to work on p9 with the **same partner**. Now may be a good time to review [our course policies](https://cs220.cs.wisc.edu/f22/syllabus.html).

# + [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# ## Testing your code:
#
# Along with this notebook, you must have downloaded the file `p9_test.py`. If you are curious about how we test your code, you can explore this file, and specifically the value of the variable `expected_json`, to understand the expected answers to the questions.
#
# **Important:** `p9_test.py` **cannot** verify your answers when the output is an image. Your **plots** will be **manually graded** by graders, so you must **manually** confirm that your plots look correct by comparing with the images provided in the notebook.

# + [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# ## Introduction:
#
# In p8, you created very useful helper functions to parse the raw IMDb dataset. You also created useful data structures to store the data. In this project, you will be building on the work you did in p8 to analyze your favorite movies. This is a shorter project than usual, and **p9 will only have 10 questions for you to solve**.

# + [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# ## Data:
#
# Between p8 and p9, the movies dataset has been updated to hold many more movies. The `movies.csv` file that you will use in p9 contains ~200,000 movies, and the `mapping.csv` file contains data on ~600,000 movie titles and people. Thankfully, the data in both files are stored in exactly the same format as the files you worked with in p8. So, all your functions should continue to work in p9. Please remember to download the [latest datasets](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs220/cs220-f22-projects/-/tree/main/p9) before starting this project. 

# + [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# ## Project Requirements:
#
# You **may not** hardcode indices or the lengths of lists in your code. We'll **manually deduct** points from your autograder score on Gradescope during code review.
#
# **Store** your final answer for each question in the **variable specified for each question**. This step is important because Otter grades your work by comparing the value of this variable against the correct answer.
#
# For some of the questions, we'll ask you to write (then use) a function to compute the answer. If you compute the answer **without** creating the function we ask you to write, we'll **manually deduct** points from your autograder score on Gradescope, even if the way you did it produced the correct answer.
#
# Required Functions:
# - `get_movies`
# - `plot_dict`
# - `bucketize`
#
# In this project, you will also be required to define certain **data structures**. If you do not create these data structures exactly as specified, we'll **manually deduct** points from your autograder score on Gradescope, even if the way you did it produced the correct answer.
#
# Required Data Structures:
# - `movies`
# - `cast_buckets`
# - `director_buckets`
# - `genre_buckets`
# - `year_buckets`
#
# You are only allowed to define these data structures **once** and we'll **manually deduct** points from your autograder score on Gradescope if you redefine the values of these variables.
#
# In this project, you will be asked to create **lists** of movies. For all such questions, **unless it is explicitly mentioned otherwise**, the movies should be in the **same order** as in the `movies.csv` file. Similarly, for each movie, the **list** of `genres`, `directors`, and `cast` members should always be in the **same order** as in the `movies.csv` file.
#
# Students are only allowed to use Python commands and concepts that have been taught in the course prior to the release of p9. We will **manually deduct** points from your autograder score on Gradescope otherwise.
#
# For more details on what will cause you to lose points during code review and specific requirements, please take a look at the [Grading rubric](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs220/cs220-f22-projects/-/blob/main/p9/rubric.md).

# In p8, you were provided with a function `find_specific_movies` which functioned as some sort of a 'search bar' for the movies dataset.

Making copies frequently is **not** a good coding practice. For this project, we will provide **a new version** of `find_specific_movies` that does **not** require `copy`. Please go through the following function:

# ### Function 1: `bucketize(movies_list, category)` 
#
# This function should take in a **list** of movie **dictionaries** as well as a **category** (i.e. `title`, `year`, `duration`, `genres`, `rating`, `directors`, or `cast`), and *bucketize* the **list** of movie **dictionaries** by this **category**.
#
# For example, the output of `bucketize(movies, 'rating')` should be a **dictionary** so that all the unique values of `rating` of the movies in `movies` are the **keys** and the correspoding **values** would be a **list** of all movie **dictionaries** with that rating (e.g., the value of the key *6.4* should be the **list** of movie dictionaries with `rating` of *6.4*).
#
# The output of `bucketize(movies, 'rating')` should look like this:
#
# ```python
# {6.4: [{'title': 'Lejos de África',
#    'year': 1996,
#    'duration': 115,
#    'genres': ['Drama'],
#    'rating': 6.4,
#    'directors': ['Cecilia Bartolomé'],
#    'cast': ['Alicia Bogo',
#     'Xabier Elorriaga',
#     'Isabel Mestres',
#     'Carlos Cruz']},
#   {'title': 'Kobbari Bondam',
#    'year': 1991,
#    'duration': 149,
#    'genres': ['Comedy'],
#    'rating': 6.4,
#    'directors': ['Raviteja K.'],
#    'cast': ['Rajendra Prasad', 'Nirosha', 'Sudhakar', 'Kota Srinivasa Rao']},
#        ...
#       ],
#  2.1: [{'title': 'Amityville Cult',
#   'year': 2021,
#   'duration': 85,
#   'genres': ['Horror'],
#   'rating': 2.1,
#   'directors': ['Trey Murphy'],
#   'cast': ['James Burleson',
#    'Chance Gibbs',
#    'Micha Marie Stevens',
#    'Tom Young',
#    'Patrick McAlister',
#    'Eric Oberto',
#    'Lara Williams']},
#  {'title': 'Jungle Goddess',
#   'year': 1948,
#   'duration': 62,
#   'genres': ['Action', 'Adventure', 'Crime'],
#   'rating': 2.1,
#   'directors': ['Lewis D. Collins'],
#   'cast': ['George Reeves', 'Wanda McKay', 'Ralph Byrd', 'Armida']},
#        ...
#       ],
#  ...
# }
# ```
#
# Similarly, the output of `bucketize(movies, 'cast')` should be a **dictionary** so that all the unique `cast` members of the movies in `movies` are the **keys** and the correspoding **values** would be a **list** of all movie **dictionaries** with that cast member as one of their `cast` (e.g., the value of the key *Kate Winslet* should be the **list** of movie dictionaries with *Kate Winslet* as one of their `cast` members).
#
# The output of `bucketize(movies, 'cast')` should look like this:
#
# ```python
# {'Alicia Bogo': [{'title': 'Lejos de África',
#    'year': 1996,
#    'duration': 115,
#    'genres': ['Drama'],
#    'rating': 6.4,
#    'directors': ['Cecilia Bartolomé'],
#    'cast': ['Alicia Bogo',
#     'Xabier Elorriaga',
#     'Isabel Mestres',
#     'Carlos Cruz']}],
#  'Xabier Elorriaga': [{'title': 'Lejos de África',
#    'year': 1996,
#    'duration': 115,
#    'genres': ['Drama'],
#    'rating': 6.4,
#    'directors': ['Cecilia Bartolomé'],
#    'cast': ['Alicia Bogo',
#     'Xabier Elorriaga',
#     'Isabel Mestres',
#     'Carlos Cruz']},
#   {'title': 'Companys, procés a Catalunya',
#    'year': 1979,
#    'duration': 125,
#    'genres': ['Biography', 'Drama', 'History'],
#    'rating': 6.2,
#    'directors': ['Josep Maria Forn'],
#    'cast': ['Luis Iriondo',
#     'Marta Angelat',
#     'Montserrat Carulla',
#     'Xabier Elorriaga']},
#      ...
#     ],
#  ...
# }
# ```
#
# **Hints:** Note that depending on whether or not the `category` represents a **list** or not, your function will have to behave differently. In p8, you created a function `bucketize_by_genre` that *bucketized* the list of movies by their genre. Take a moment to find that function; it will help you here. Also, take a moment to look at the buckets you made in lab-p9.

# + tags=[]
# replace the ... with your code to finish the definition of bucketize

def bucketize(movie_list, category):
    buckets = {}
    for movie in movie_list:
        category_value = movie[category] #TODO: Access the category value from a movie
        if type(category_value) == list:
            for item in movie[category]:
                if item not in buckets:

                buckets[category_value] = [movie]
            else:
                buckets[category_value].append(movie)


    return buckets

# + [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# **Important:** Just like `get_movies`, `bucketize` is quite a time-consuming function to run. Hence, you do **not** want to call `bucketize` on the same list of movies and category **more than once**. Throughout the project, we will frequently use bucketized lists of movies organized by their `cast`, `directors`, `genre`, and `year`. Rather than calling `bucketize` several times, we will store the bucketized lists in following variables:

# + tags=[]
# define buckets for categories mentioned below, but do NOT display any of them

# bucketize the full list of movies by their cast.
cast_buckets = bucketize(movies, 'cast')
# bucketize the full list of movies by their directors.
director_buckets = bucketize(movies,'directors')
# bucketize the full list of movies by their genre.
genre_buckets = bucketize(movies, 'genres')
# bucketize the full list of movies by their year.

# **Question 6:** **Plot** the **number** of movies released in each *decade* as a **bar graph**.
#
# You **must** first compute a **dictionary** which maps each **decade** to the **number** of movies in released in that **decade**. This dictionary should look like this:
#
# ```python
# {'1991 to 2000': 18496,
#  '2021 to 2030': 9173,
#  '1961 to 1970': 14216,
#  '1951 to 1960': 10981,
#  '2011 to 2020': 59249,
#  '2001 to 2010': 33658,
#  '1941 to 1950': 7807,
#  '1971 to 1980': 15556,
#  '1981 to 1990': 17181,
#  '1921 to 1930': 3014,
#  '1931 to 1940': 8201,
#  '1911 to 1920': 1068,
#  '1901 to 1910': 9,
#  '1891 to 1900': 1}
# ```
#
# Then, you may use `plot_dict` to plot the data in that dictionary.
#
# **Important Warning:** `p9_test.py` can check that the **dictionary** has the correct key/value pairs, but it **cannot** check if your plot appears on the screen, or whether the axes are correctly labelled. Your plots will be **manually graded**, and you will **lose points** if your plot is not visible, or if it is not properly labelled.

# **Food for thought:** Can you explain the shape of this plot? Why do you think there was a dip between the decades `1931 to 1940` and `1941 to 1950`? Can you explain why the number of movies appears to plateau around `1991 to 2000` before increasing drastically?
